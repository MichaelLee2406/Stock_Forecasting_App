# Stock_Forecasting_App
This presentation introduces a forecasting system built with the Streamlit library, designed to transform raw financial data into an interactive prediction platform. It covers the methodology of using time series data from Yahoo Finance, applying wavelet denoising for noise reduction, and implementing models such as LSTM, GRU, RNN, and HOON (High-Order Neural Networks). The results show that while all models capture general stock price trends, HOON demonstrates closer alignment with actual prices. Evaluation metrics like MSE, MAE, and RMSE are used to compare accuracy. The study highlights the importance of forecasting models in decision-making and suggests that future work will focus on leveraging AI to further enhance predictive capabilities
